# Twenty Sixteen (Translateindo)

An ongoing customization attempt at the Twenty Sixteen WordPress theme for use at [Translateindo](https://www.translateindo.com).

## Notable customizations

* Reddit-inspired nested comments. This needs [Comment Popularity](https://github.com/BobbyWibowo/comment-popularity) plugin for vote up/down buttons.
* Chapters navigation.
* and maybe more in the future...?

## License

The original Twenty Sixteen used [GNU General Public License v2](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html) or [later](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html), so all of my current and future customizations in this repository use and will use the same license as well.

Honestly though, I'd have preferred to be using a "do whatever you want with this, just donâ€™t sue me" license (MIT), but oh well.
